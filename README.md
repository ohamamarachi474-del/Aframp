# 🌍 AFRAMP: Africa's Financial Bridge

<!-- CI/CD Pipeline Test -->

## Don't Trust, Verify

AFRAMP is a blockchain payment platform designed specifically for the African market, enabling seamless conversion between local currencies and digital assets. We specialize in **onramp** (fiat-to-crypto) and **offramp** (crypto-to-fiat) transactions using African stablecoins and provide essential services like bill payments.

Built on the **Stellar network** with multi-chain compatibility, AFRAMP connects traditional African financial systems (like mobile money and local banks) to global blockchain ecosystems. Our platform tackles the high costs and slow speeds of cross-border payments by leveraging blockchain for near-instant, low-fee settlements.

### Who It's For

- **African Users & Diaspora**: Send remittances, pay bills, and manage finances with minimal fees.
- **Businesses & Developers**: Integrate pan-African payments and treasury solutions.
- **Contributors**: Help build the future of African fintech with open, verifiable systems.

## 💳 Onramp Page (Wallet-Connected Flow)

The onramp page lives at `/onramp` and assumes a connected Stellar wallet address is already stored in `localStorage`.

### Run Locally

1. Start the dev server (see setup above).
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/onramp`.
3. Ensure `localStorage.walletAddress` is set to a valid Stellar address (56 characters, starts with `G`).

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required for the onramp page. Exchange rates are fetched from CoinGecko on the client.

### Supported Currencies & Assets

- Fiat: NGN, KES, GHS, ZAR, UGX
- Crypto: cNGN, cKES, cGHS, USDC, XLM

### Payment Methods & Fees

- Bank Transfer: 0% processing fee
- Card Payment: 1.5% processing fee
- Mobile Money: 0.5% processing fee

### Known Limitations

- Wallet switching is a client-only selector and does not yet integrate with Freighter accounts.
- Exchange rates are best-effort with cached fallbacks on API failure.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Run Unit Tests:** Execute `npm test` to launch the test runner.
- **Code Linting:** Use `npm run lint` to check code style and catch errors.
- **Build for Production:** Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build in the `build/` folder.
